# Mobile Flashcards Project

This is the last project of Udacity's React Nanodegree program.

I have built an Android app with React Native.

The app allows users to create decks with cards with question and answer and to quiz themselves over them.

The app saves the time of the last quiz taken and set a notification to remind the user to take the quizzes after one day, everyday.


## Use the app

The app will start at an empty list of decks, to start using it tap on the add deck card and add a deck with some questions.

When you are done adding decks and cards, see them in the decks tab and select them to take the quiz! 


### Run the project

 The app was built with Node v12.18.3 and requires at least node ^10
